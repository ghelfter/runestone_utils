This is a set of utilities to generate the rst files for the Runestone
Interactive utility. It provides an interactive prompting for the type of
question, the ID of the question and then any question-specific details.

The program will take an optional command line argument for an output file,
otherwise it will output the question to the standard output stream. The
output can be copied and pasted into the browser prompt for the question
code, since their standard question template did not work without significant
modification. A generation program is significantly better.

Note: As of right now, this project is on hold, as it looks like Runestone
may be taken off the table, as it isn't doing what we thought it might
be able to. Thus, I will halt development of this piece of code here too.
